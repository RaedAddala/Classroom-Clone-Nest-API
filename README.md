- **Containerized Deployment**: Dockerized for easy deployment and management.
- **RESTful APIs**: Provides a robust set of APIs for managing classroom activities.

## Services

PgAdmin Login:

    - email: admin@admin.com
    - password: pgadmin4

- Backend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Access the WebSocket server at `ws://localhost:3000`.
- Swagger documentation is available under `http://localhost:3000/api`.
- To generate and download a Swagger JSON file, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-json`.

## Monitoring

Best way to moniter your containers is through the docker desktop application, go to containers sections and open the container you are interested in to see logs, have an ssh access, or to check stats.

## Installation

Make sure you have Docker and Node.js installed.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Create the `.env` file and fill the variables:

    - follow the structure found in the `.env.example` depending on whether you are using it for dev or prod.
    - fill in the hostname, password and credentials from the dockerfile
    - run this command to get a secret key

    ```bash
    node -p "require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex');"
    ```

5. Run `docker-compose up` to start the Docker containers.

## Run this Lab

- `docker-compose up` to start all images and run the Servers and Services.
- `docker-compose up <SERVICE-NAME>` to start only the desired image.
- `docker-compose down -v --rmi all --remove-orphans` to close the images and clean things up.
- `docker-compose down` to only close the images.

## NOTE

To enforce conform style and to avoid errors/bugs/vulunrabilities that can be identified by the **Linter**, please, use `npm run lint` in both the Backend and Frontend before making any commits.

Please use `npm run format` too, to enforce style.
